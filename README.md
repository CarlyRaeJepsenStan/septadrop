### Credits

`CMakeLists.txt` is based on [a tutorial by codevion on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ-i-UfGgQ), and the specific SFML configuration is from [an article by Dane Bulat on Medium](https://dane-bulat.medium.com/cmake-building-sfml-and-game-projects-on-linux-3947b3ba6e8). Please check these out if you're just getting started, they were helpful to me as a beginner.

[`src/Main.cpp`](src/Main.cpp) is taken from the [official SFML and Linux getting started guide](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-linux.php).
